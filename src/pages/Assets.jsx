              <h2>What is Forex</h2>
              <p>
                The definition of Forex is the trading of different currency
                pairs. The trading occurs between one currency against another.
                One currency is compared with the other. For example, the rate
                of the USD/GBP currency pair is 0.66, then it means that 1 USA
                dollar costs 0.66 British Pounds. The goal of Forex is to see if
                the American dollar will enhance or not its price equated to the
                British Pound. If it does, then the trader should buy the USDGBP
                pair on this term.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the case when the price goes down, for instance from 0.66 to
                0.64, then the USA dollar has a descended position. If the price
                moves in the opposite way, for example from 0.66 to 0.69, then
                the USA dollar is increasing its price against the British
                Pound. You will meet often the terms “short” and “lot” where
                “long”, in that instance, correlate with the Dollar and “short”
                refers to the British Pound. Because the GBP stated its price in
                the USD. The other important expression that you must take into
                consideration is “the major”, which signify the ruling global
                currency pairs, such as the AUDUSD, the USDJPY, the EURUSD, the
                USDCAD, the USDCHF and the GBPUSD. And every one of them has the
                Dollar inside. We have the phrase “cross pairs” which refers to
                pairs that do not have the Dollar in them.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Forex does not function as a real physical currency transaction.
                All transitions and swaps are going on the Internet, which means
                that this market works only as speculation with currencies.
                Approximate statistic says that more over 4 trillion dollars are
                being swapped every day all around the globe, but all the assets
                are engaged in many types – future, forward, currency exchange
                and so on.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Forex trading works without breaks, during the whole week
                and 24 hours a day, but it has holidays on weekends. Look for
                additional Forex information at the Waysfx learning section.

                  Recently, there has been seeing such a big jump in the volume
                  of gold and trades with it. Gold is seen as a quite gainful

                  big gold quantities. Gold has always been a chief economic
                  influence, and it will develop in the future as well. You
                  should bear this in a mind just because gold is strongly
                  tangled with many currencies. Gold could have a strong and
                  considerable impact on its value.

                  what most people decide to do, but if you`d like you might as

                  Worthily said that silver has a twin economic nature. First,
                  it is a precious metal, but it also has the industrial
                  usability, which is one of the most notifiable factors to

                  can see the same with currency pairs that fluctuate on the
                  market and could make a nice impact on the silver value.
                  Silver is highly demanded usually, specifically in the solar
